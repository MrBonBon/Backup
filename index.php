		<h2> Hello</h2>
		
	<p >Hello, thank you for taking the time to look at my website. As you can see it doesn't look that great.
	   That should change in the future to be a beautiful website.

		<h2> Educational Goals </h2>
	<p> After high school I want to go to college. I don't know exactly which college I want to go to yet.
		I do know that I will be going to Sinclair for at least two years. I hope to go to Wright State, Ohio University, or Ohio State University.

		<h2> Job Goals </h2>
		<p> My dream job is to have my own gaming studio with some close friends or to work at Bethesda Gaming Studio.
			I either want to be a programmer or a creative writer for those jobs. If i decide to go with a different career path
			then I will major in music composition and hopefully make music for video games or movies. If I am unable to acquire those jobs
			then I will become a music teacher and spread the wonders of music.
