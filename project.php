	<p>
		This is a simple project I did the 1st semester of my Junior school year. I chose this code because I want to show that even simple codes can be useful.
		 If you like you can download it

	<h2>Monthly Budget</h2>
	<p>
		This next project was to tell if you have gone over a monthly spending on certain things. For me I put down things that related to me:
		Coca Cola, french fries, chips, simple items that I would buy. At the end it tells you the total amount that you have spent.
		I chose this code becaus it is always nice to be able to manage how much you've spent a month.
		If you would like to download, it you can do that
